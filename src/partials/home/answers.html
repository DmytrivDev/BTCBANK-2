    <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
    <b>Where is my wallet address?</b>
    <p>You can find your wallet address by navigating to the Wallets on the left side of the trading page, choosing your desired cryptocurrency, then clicking "Copy wallet."</p>
    
    <b>Can I cancel a digital currency transaction?</b>
    <p>Transactions cannot be cancelled or altered once they are initiated. This is what allows merchants to accept digital currency without the risk of chargebacks. It also means users must be careful when they send funds, as transactions cannot be undone, outside of asking the recipient for a refund.</p>
    
    <b>I sent funds to the wrong address. How do I get them back?</b>
    <p>Due to the irreversible nature of digital currency protocols, transactions can neither be cancelled nor reversed once sent. In this scenario, it would be necessary to contact the receiving party and seek their cooperation in returning the funds. If you do not know the owner of the address, there are no possible actions you can take to retrieve the funds.</p>
    <p>Because of this, it is essential to exercise caution when sending. It is always recommended that you double-check that the address you are sending to exactly matches the address of the recipient before sending.</p>
