              <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
              <h4>Where is my wallet address?</h4>
              <p>
                You can find your wallet address by navigating to the Wallets on
                the left side of the trading page, choosing your desired
                cryptocurrency, then clicking "Copy wallet."
              </p>

              <h4>Can I cancel a digital currency transaction?</h4>
              <p>
                Transactions cannot be cancelled or altered once they are
                initiated. This is what allows merchants to accept digital
                currency without the risk of chargebacks. It also means users
                must be careful when they send funds, as transactions cannot be
                undone, outside of asking the recipient for a refund.
              </p>

              <h4>
                I sent funds to the wrong address. How do I get them back?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Due to the irreversible nature of digital currency protocols,
                transactions can neither be cancelled nor reversed once sent. In
                this scenario, it would be necessary to contact the receiving
                party and seek their cooperation in returning the funds. If you
                do not know the owner of the address, there are no possible
                actions you can take to retrieve the funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of this, it is essential to exercise caution when
                sending. It is always recommended that you double-check that the
                address you are sending to exactly matches the address of the
                recipient before sending.

              <h4>SEPA Transfers</h4>
              <h4>What is a SEPA transfer?</h4>
              <p>
                SEPA is a bank transfer method used to send payments denominated
                in Euros within the Single Euro Payments Area. These payments
                typically only take a couple of business days. SEPA transfers
                can only be denominated in EUR.
              </p>

              <h4>How to make a SEPA payment:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>Check if your bank offers SEPA transfers</li>
                <li>
                  Have a verified ID document, utility bill, and selfie added to
                  your BTCBNK account
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>

                  support deposits in EUR
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Overview</h4>

              <p>
                At BTCBNK, we implement industry-leading security measures to
                protect your digital assets and personal information. Our
                multi-layered security approach ensures that your account
                remains secure while maintaining accessibility for legitimate
                account activities.
              </p>

              <h4>Account Security</h4>
              <h4>What if I forgot my password?</h4>
              <p>
                If you've lost or forgotten your password, you can reset your
                password by visiting
                <a href="https://wallet.BTCBNK.io/reset-password"
                  >BTCBNK Reset Password</a
                >. You'll need access to your email account and your
                authentication app to get back into your account.
              </p>

              <h4>How is my bank account/credit card information protected?</h4>
              <p>
                BTCBNK makes everyday improvements to ensure your personal
                information safety. Account numbers and routing numbers are
                stored using high-level encryption on our servers. In addition,
                all traffic goes over SSL to prevent third parties from
                accessing your connection. Employee access is strongly
                restricted and we conduct serious background checks on all our
                employees. If you would prefer not to share your credentials,
                please select "Other Bank" when adding your bank account, to use
                our deposit verification method instead. For more information,
                please visit the BTCBNK <a href="#">User Agreement</a> and
                <a href="./policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
              </p>

              <h4>Security Best Practices</h4>
              <p>
                BTCBNK strongly recommends you follow these guidelines to
                protect your account from unauthorized access:
              </p>

              <h4>Customer Support</h4>
              <p>
                BTCBNK staff will never ask for your password, 2-factor
                authentication codes, or other login credentials. We will never
                ask you to install remote login or remote support software on
                your computer. If anyone claiming to be associated with BTCBNK
                Support requests this information, immediately contact us.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may disable your account at any time using the disable links
                in password reset, transaction confirmation, and device
                confirmation emails.
              </p>

              <h4>Password</h4>
              <p>
                We strongly recommend using a complex and unique password that
                is not shared or similar to those used on any other websites.
                Change your password periodically (about every 3 months) and use
                a completely new password each time. Using a password manager
                such as 1Password or LastPass makes this easy to manage. Never
                disclose your password to anyone. A BTCBNK employee will NEVER
                ask for your password.
              </p>

              <h4>2-Factor Authentication</h4>
              <p>
                Take advantage of the 2-factor authentication (2FA) services we
                offer or use a TOTP app like Google Authenticator. TOTP apps are
                considerably more secure for 2FA codes since they are tied to a
                specific physical device, not a phone number, which could be
                compromised in a phone porting attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your email provider offers this functionality, consider
                adding 2FA to the email address you use to log in to BTCBNK. Do
                not use VOIP, Google Voice, or other phone providers that send
                you 2FA messages via email to the address you use to log in to
                BTCBNK.
              </p>

              <h4>Email</h4>
              <p>
                Do not use the same password on your email account that you do
                on your BTCBNK account. If your email provider offers it,
                activate 2-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account to
                add an extra layer of security.
              </p>

              <h4>Overview</h4>

              <p>
                At BTCBNK, we prioritize the protection of your personal data
                and privacy rights. We are committed to transparency in our data
                collection practices and ensuring compliance with global privacy
                regulations, including GDPR.
              </p>

              <h4>Understanding GDPR</h4>
              <h4>What is GDPR?</h4>
              <p>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data law in
                the European Union ("EU") which updates existing data protection
                laws to strengthen the protection of personal data for
                individuals who reside in the EU. The GDPR aims to increase
                transparency for how personal data is used and to provide EU
                residents ("data subjects") with more control over their data.
                This law goes into effect on 1 Feb 2025.
              </p>

              <h4>Data Usage</h4>
              <h4>How does BTCBNK use my data?</h4>
              <p>
                BTCBNK takes data protection and client privacy seriously and
                constantly improves its security measures. BTCBNK only uses its
                client's data to verify identity, enable transactions, and
                improve our product and services.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we do collect data it is primarily because it is mandated
                by law — such as when we must comply with anti money laundering
                laws — or to verify your identity and protect you from potential
                fraudulent activity. To learn more, please see our updated
                Privacy Policy.
              </p>
